#Reflections about GPS 1.1

###What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Prior to this session, I was struggling understanding the concept behind master and feature branches. It was cconfusing when I committed my code as I was unsure of what was going where. This session definitely helped clarify what exactly I am doing! 

### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The aformentioned differences between master and feature branch commits as well as having a better understanding of git fetch and opening docs. 

### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked questions around the feature branch creation, the 3 stages of a commit (which we researched together), refreshing my memory on markdowns and working to understand the best practices in creating commit messages.


### What still confuses you about Git? 

At the moment nothing is too confusing in Git, though I'm sure the more I learn the more questions I will eventually have. 

###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was a lot of fun! I enjoyed working with Tyler very much. It was a little nerve wrecking because this was someone I did not know and the process is still very new to me. Once we were head first in it though, we worked together throughout and piggy-backed on writing the code. It was a great team exercise and I am excited for the next session!
